        <h3>I'm going to tell you a bit about myself:</h3>
        <p>I'm 25 years old, a dad to two boys, and I've been married for four years.<br /> My life is all about my love for tech, gaming, books, constant learning, and my total geekiness.<br /> Right now, I'm all in on a career change, moving out of the IT world and diving headfirst into the exciting realm of coding.<br /> I'm super pumped about this change, and it shows in my recent courses, which have all been about programming.</p>
        <p>I've got a clear mission: becoming a kick-ass full-stack developer.<br /> I'm always hungry for knowledge, eager to tackle challenges, and ready to roll with the latest tech trends.<br /> My goal is to keep pushing for the infinite, not just in terms of what I know, but in my ability to create solutions through code.</p>
        <p>With my determination to grow and my never-ending quest for learning, I'm confident that I'm on the right track to reach my professional goals in the programming field. Plus, I'm lucky to have my family's support in this journey.</p>
